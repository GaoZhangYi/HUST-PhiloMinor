slur的meaning/sense和对应的中性词的是一样的，涵义相同

一般人认为传统的意义frege理论解决不了slur的歧视性问题
Ernie Lepore, Matthew Stone：
slur只表达其原本的意义，不质疑Frege的意义理论，slur的语气是排除在意义理论之外，

The view put forward in this chapter about slur terms is that their interpretations require expansive（需要建构的、否定的太多了——代价大）, open-ended engagement with an utterance and its linguistic meaning, through a host of distinctive kinds of reasoning. This reasoning may include inferences about the speaker's psychology and her intentions—in light of the full social and historical context—but it may involve approaching the utterance through strategies for imaginative elaboration and emotional attunement, as required, for example, for metaphor, poetic diction, irony, sarcasm, and humor. In the face of their heterogeneityand open-endedness, these interpretive strategies are most perspicuously elucidated through critical attention to the psychological, social, historical, and even artistic considerations at play in specific cases. Thus, in contrast to the common practice in philosophy and linguistics, this chapter will not offer a general account of the interpretation of slur terms. It puts forward that there can be no suchthing.

One way to approach this suggestion is through Frege’s discussion of tone. For Frege, “dog” and “cur”（贬义的dog，坏狗）agree in meaning but each “puts us…in mind” of dierent associations. For example, anyone who uses “cur” “speaks pejoratively, but this is not part of the thought expressed” (Frege 1897: 140; cf. also Picardi2007). Here, Frege oers a famous statement of the view that we will elaborate, that interpretive dierences need not be due to dierences in meaning. However, this view must be developed and amplied to give a satisfying account of the interpretation of slur terms. For, as Hom (2008) emphasizes, Frege’s remarks on tone oer no explanation of the dierence between pejoratives and their neutral counterparts; and, as Anderson and Lepore (2013b) argue, dierences in tone cannot be the whole story.
